Learning the 7 layers of the OSI model can be difficult. 
Here is a funny way of learning the layer going from 7 - 1. Remember: A penguin said that nobody drinks Pepsi. 

7. Application        A
6. Presentation       Penguin 
5. Session            Said 
4. Transport          That 
2. Network            Nobody
2. Data Link          Drinks 
1. Physical           Pepsi
